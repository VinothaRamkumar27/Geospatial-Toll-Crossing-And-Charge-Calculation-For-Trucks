# üöõ Toll Plaza Crossing Detection and Cost Estimation

This project uses Python to analyze vehicle GPS data and detect toll plaza crossings using geospatial comparison. It visualizes toll locations and vehicle paths using Folium and calculates the total trip cost based on toll rates.

## üìÇ Project Overview

The script performs the following tasks:

1. **Loads vehicle tracking data (`copyyyy.csv`)** and **toll plaza report data (`report_truck_bus_output_output.csv`)**.
2. **Calculates distances** between vehicle GPS coordinates and toll plaza coordinates using the `geopy` library.
3. **Identifies toll crossings** when a vehicle is within a 1 km radius of a toll location.
4. **Logs and sums up toll costs** for each trip.
5. **Plots toll plazas and vehicle paths** on a Folium map.
6. **Exports a trip summary CSV** with trip ID, vehicle number, total tolls crossed, and total cost.
7. **Saves the interactive map** as `toll_plaza_map.html`.

## üìå Dependencies

Make sure to install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas folium geopy
'''
